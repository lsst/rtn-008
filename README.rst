LSST Processing of Gravitational Wave TOO Data in the Early Operations Era
##########################################################################

RTN-008
=======

Since the watershed discovery of an electromagnetic counterpart to the LIGO gravitational wave source GW170817, multi-messenger astrophysics has emerged as a major area of strategic focus for the NSF. LSSTâ€™s depth, survey speed, and data management systems will make it a key asset in the search for EM counterparts. Exploiting this capability in the first year of LSST operations (GW observing run O4) may require special actions, however. We discuss potential approaches to data access, reference building, and special data processing.

Build
=====

This repository includes lsst-texmf_ as a Git submodule.
Clone this repository::

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rubin-observatory/rtn-008

Compile the PDF::

    make

Clean built files::

    make clean

Updating acronyms
-----------------

A table of the technote's acronyms and their definitions are maintained in the ``acronyms.tex`` file, which is committed as part of this repository.
To update the acronyms table in ``acronyms.tex``::

    make acronyms.tex

*Note: this command requires that this repository was cloned as a submodule.*

The acronyms discovery code scans the LaTeX source for probable acronyms.
You can ensure that certain strings aren't treated as acronyms by adding them to the `skipacronyms.txt <./skipacronyms.txt>`_ file.

The lsst-texmf_ repository centrally maintains definitions for LSST acronyms.
You can also add new acronym definitions, or override the definitions of acronyms, by editing the `myacronyms.txt <./myacronyms.txt>`_ file.

Updating lsst-texmf
-------------------

`lsst-texmf`_ includes BibTeX files, the ``lsstdoc`` class file, and acronym definitions, among other essential tooling for LSST's LaTeX documentation projects.
To update to a newer version of `lsst-texmf`_, you can update the submodule in this repository::

   git submodule update --init --recursive

Commit, then push, the updated submodule.
